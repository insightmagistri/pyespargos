# ESPARGOS Python Client Library + Demos

<img src="img/espargos-logo.png" width="40%" align="right">

*pyespargos* is the python library for working with the [ESPARGOS](https://espargos.net/) WiFi channel sounder.
ESPARGOS is a real-time-capable, phase-synchronous 2 &times; 4 WiFi antenna array built from Espressif ESP32 chips that facilities that development and deployment of WiFi sensing applications.

**`pyespargos` is still under development. Currently, only HT40 packets (40MHz wide channels) are supported.**

*pyespargos* comes with a selection of demo applications for testing ESPARGOS.
The following demos are provided in the `demos` folder of this repository:

* `music-spectrum`: Use the [MUSIC algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUSIC_(algorithm)) to display a spatial (angular) spectrum. Demonstrates angle of arrival (AoA) estimation.
* `phases-over-space`: Show the average received phase for each ESPARGOS antenna.
* `instantanteous-csi`: Plot the current frequency-domain or time-domain transfer function of the measured channel.
* `phases-over-time`: Plot the average received phase for every antenna over time.
* `combined-array`: Combine multiple ESPARGOS arrays into one large antenna array and visualize the average received phase for each antenna. Requires multiple ESPARGOS arrays.

Unless otherwise noted, the demos connect to exactly one ESPARGOS antenna array with 2 &times; 4 antennas.

## Installation
* Run the setuptools-based installation script:
```bash
sudo python3 setup.py install
```
* Import the `espargos` package in your Python application. Use this minimal sample code to get started:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import espargos
import time

pool = espargos.Pool([espargos.Board("192.168.1.2")])
pool.start()
pool.calibrate(duration = 2)
backlog = espargos.CSIBacklog(pool, size = 20)
backlog.start()

# Wait for a while to collect some WiFi packets to the backlog...
time.sleep(4)

csi_ht40 = backlog.get_ht40()
print("Received CSI: ", csi_ht40)
```
* Take a look at the demo applications for advanced usage
* To run the demos that come with *pyespargos*, you may need to install additional dependencies that are not listed in `requirements.txt` (most notably, PyQt6-related packages)

## Basics

### WiFi
* ESPARGOS uses the L-LTF and/or HT-LTF fields of 802.11g/n frames to extract channel state information (CSI).
* ESPARGOS is totally passive, it only acts as a receiver in promiscuous mode. It provides CSI for any WiFi frames it receives.
* To receive frames, the transmitter and ESPARGOS must use the same WiFi channel.
* 802.11n supports channel bandiwdths of 20MHz and 40MHz. The ESPARGOS hardware and firmware supports both bandwidth configurations, but *pyespargos* currently only works with frames which use 40MHz of bandwidth (known as "HT40").

### Communication between pyespargos and ESPARGOS
* ESPARGOS provides an HTTP / WebSockets API on port 80.
* CSI is streamed in binary format over a WebSocket.
* Control commands are issued via HTTP.

### The Backlog
* The L-LFT and HT-LTF fields used for channel estimation are really short compared to the total length of the WiFi frame.
* This results in really noisy CSI estimates.
* Therefore, it is a good idea to average CSI over multiple WiFi packets.
* To this end, *pyespargos* offsers a *backlog* functionality, where CSI from the last N packets is cached. The backlog is implemented as a ringbuffer.
* To obtain higher-quality CSI, you may use the CSI interpolation helpers in `espargos/util.py`.

### Calibration
* ESPARGOS is based on phase-synchronized ESP32 SoCs. Phase synchronization is achieved in two steps:

	- All ESP32 chips are clocked from the same 40MHz reference clock, which makes them frequency-synchronous.
	- To correct for PLL phase ambiguity a WiFi frames is distributed to all ESP32 chips over a known channel (microstrip traces of known length on the PCB).

* Now we know the initial phase of the local oscillator (LO) signal on every ESP32.
* With *pyespargos*, this calibration can be performed with just one command: `pool.calibrate()`
* In our observations, this initial phase offset between antennas remains relatively static over time, so one calibration of ESPARGOS should be sufficient.

### Sampling Time Offset
* While ESPARGOS provides phase (= LO signal) synchronization between antennas, it does not provide time synchronization (= ADC sampling clock).
* This is because the receiver hardware in every ESP32 applies a receiver-specific sampling time offset correction to the received frame, but the [esp32-wifi-lib](https://github.com/espressif/esp32-wifi-lib) does not expose this information to the application firmware.
* However, this is not a hardware limitation as the ESP32 clearly supports precise timestamping (it supports 802.11mc FTM).
* There is [an open esp-idf issue](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/issues/9843) regarding this problem: We need to get precise reception timestamps from the WiFi binary blob.

## Additional Non-Public Demo Applications
